          The Galaxy Fold represents more than eight years of design,
          engineering, and brand new tech, just to realize a phone with a
          flexible screen that works. We’re talking new malleable adhesives and
          complicated composite polymers made specifically to support the bendy
          display. And now after months of teasing, I’ve finally gotten a chance
          to check one out in the flesh. And despite its nearly $2,000 price
          tag, the Galaxy Fold is proof that the whole bendy phone trend could
          be more than just a fad.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the first touch, the Galaxy Fold feels solid. It emits a super
          satisfying snap you every time you close the phone, something that
          echoes the best thing about flip phones from back in the day. But the
          other thing you notice before even opening the phone is how long the
          Galaxy Fold is—it’s a true candy bar of a handset
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, you can either use the exterior “cover screen” as you
          would any other smartphone, although its 4.6-inch display means you’re
          a bit limited on real estate. Of course, that’s where that big
          flexible screen comes in because as soon as you open up the phone,
          whatever was on the outside is suddenly inside on the device’s bendy
          7.3-inch display.
        </p>
        <p>
          From an angle, the Galaxy Fold’s crease is definitely there, but from
          straight on, it almost completely fades away and becomes much less
          obtrusive.

          And if you’re a heavy multitasker, things only continue to get better,
          as you can then swipe in the from the right side of the screen to get
          a little row of apps that let you open up to three different apps at
          once. Thanks to the ability to pop out one additional app inside a
          floating window, the Fold’s true multitasking app count stands at
          four.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, to ensure those transitions and app performance is as
          smooth as possible, the Galaxy Fold features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855
          processor, 512GB of storage, and a whopping 12GB of RAM. As a bonus,
          like the Galaxy S10, the Galaxy Fold features Qi wireless charging
          along with Samsung’s PowerShare tech that lets you juice up your other
          devices. Though, in terms of real-world durability, the Fold not
          having any water resistance is a bummer.

          Fold’s screen, Samsung had to leave a tiny gap in the middle.

          When you want to multitask, you can swipe in from the right to see a
          selection of recently used apps, or hit the icon on the bottom to see
          a full list.

          Now to be clear, the Fold’s ability to switch apps between screens,
          what Samsung calls App continuity, is still very much in its early
          stages. This sort of multi-app functionality isn’t even natively
          available in Android yet (it’s coming in Android Q), though Samsung
          has worked with Google and other partners to ensure a lot of major
          first and third-party apps look good on the big flexy screen. But
          that’s not always the case for less popular apps, or some games, which
          resort to a 16:9 letterboxed view.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, despite featuring two batteries that are joined together to
          form a 4,380 mAh power pack, I still have to wonder if the Galaxy Fold
          has enough longevity to keep that big display and everything else
          running. But that’s a question I should be able to answer once I’ve
          had a chance to spend more time with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of the the Galaxy Fold’s design, instead of putting a
          fingerprint reader on the front or back, Samsung put the Fold’s
          fingerprint sensor on its side
        </p>

          The Fold also comes with six total cameras, so you’re never without
          some way of taking a selfie. In front, there’s a 10-MP cam above the
          cover screen, while a second 12-MP selfie cam and an 8-MP depth cam to
          help with portrait-style shots live on the inside. However, like on a
          regular phone, the real camera talent resides in the back, with the
          Fold offering a 16-MP ultra-wide camera, a 12-MP wide-angle camera,
          and a 2x telephoto cam.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Galaxy Fold has a noticeable crease, but when you’re using it
          normally, it’s way less distracting than I anticipated. Generally, it
          fades away, potentially becoming less annoying than even a scratch on
          a screen. But depending on the situation and available ambient light,
          you may still notice it even when watching a video. It’s impressive,
          but Samsung did not magically defy the material constraints, and
          doubtless, for some people, the imperfection will be seen as a
          failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, the thickness of the device will remain controversial for
          some people. Personally, I think it wouldn’t bother me in the long run
          but for some of my colleagues who insist on tiny pants, the thickness
          will be a dealbreaker.
        </p>
        <p>
          And even if that crease and that thickness don’t wind up being too
          annoying, there’s still one more reality people will need to get over:
          $1,980 is a serious chunk of money, especially for a V1 device. This
          thing is likely to only find its home with people who value keeping up
          with the absolute bleeding edge of tech.
